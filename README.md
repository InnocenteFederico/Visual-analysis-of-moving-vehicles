# Visual analysis of moving vehicles
Traffic monitoring is a very relevant issue in modern cities, it allows
gathering useful information which can be used for enforcing traffic
laws. Such data can also be used for extracting insights about the flow
of traffic which can help to design more efficient infrastructure. The
relevance of our work is that it offers a mobile solution for traffic speed
monitoring that does not require specialized hardware as it only uses
video recordings from any type of device and simple measurements.

Goal: detect the trajectory and estimate the speed of vehicles from
video recording.

Data: a video of a straight road with moving cars such that the image
plane is not parallel to the road direction and the camera is fixed at a
known position with respect to a point on the road
